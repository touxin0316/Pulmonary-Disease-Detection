# Pulmonary-Disease-Detection
Machine Learning
Build a convolutional neural network to predict the pulmonary disease of patients from their chest X-ray (CXR)
>There are 10,000 images in the training set, 1,000 images in the validation set and 1,500 in the testing set.
> * 2 demographic features (age and gender) are provided for all patients.
> * 7 pulmonary disease labels for patients in training and validation set.
> * All CXR images has been processed with histogram equalization and down-sampled to 128 by 128.
> * Training and validation data are in the folder name as “public”. Testing data are in the folder name as “private”.

Use the training data to predict whether the patient has “Edema”.
